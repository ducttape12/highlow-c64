# High Low
A Commodore 64 BASIC port of my previous [High Low](https://www.keithott.com/software/high-low/) game.

## Overview

High Low is all about luck and playing the odds. The computer will think of a number between 1 and 100, and you need to guess if it's higher or lower than the previous number. Every time you guess correctly, you get one point.

Keep guessing and go for the high score!

## Running the Game
Grab the latest [release](https://github.com/ducttape12/highlow-c64/releases) and load it up in your favorite emulator, such as [Vice](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/).

Or even better, grab a real Commodore 64 and run it on that!
